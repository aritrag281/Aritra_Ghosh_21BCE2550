## Description
This project is a web-based chess-like game using Flask, Flask-SocketIO, and SQLAlchemy. It allows users to log in, play a game, and track moves with real-time updates.

Designed a web-based real-time strategy game using Flask, Flask-SocketIO, and SQLAlchemy, enabling users to log in, play, and
track moves with real-time updates through a server-client architecture.Developed a web client with interactive features, including clickable character pieces, valid move indicators, and move history logging, utilizing websockets for seamless communication with the server. **Implemented an AI opponent capable of playing the game using basic strategy, integrating machine learning algorithms to enhance gameplay and provide a challenging experience for users**

Bonus Features Implemented

2. Implement a dynamic team composition feature:
â—‹ Allow players to choose their team composition at the start of each game.
