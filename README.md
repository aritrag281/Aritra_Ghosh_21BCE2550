**IMPLEMENTED ALL THE BONUS CHALLENGES**

## Description
This project is a web-based chess-like game using Flask, Flask-SocketIO, and SQLAlchemy. It allows users to log in, play a game, and track moves with real-time updates.

Designed a web-based real-time strategy game using Flask, Flask-SocketIO, and SQLAlchemy, enabling users to log in, play, and
track moves with real-time updates through a server-client architecture.Developed a web client with interactive features, including clickable character pieces, valid move indicators, and move history logging, utilizing websockets for seamless communication with the server. **Implemented an AI opponent capable of playing the game using basic strategy, integrating machine learning algorithms to enhance gameplay and provide a challenging experience for users**

**IMPLEMENTED ALL THE BONUS CHALLENGES**

1 Implement additional character types with unique move patterns.
Add Hero3:
Movement: Moves 2 steps straight and one to the side in a single turn.
Attack: Kills only the character at its final landing position (if occupied by an opponent).
Move commands:
FL: 2 steps Forward, 1 step Left
FR: 2 steps Forward, 1 step Right
BL: 2 steps Backward, 1 step Left
BR: 2 steps Backward, 1 step Right
RF: 2 steps Right, 1 step Forward
RB: 2 steps Right, 1 step Backward
LF: 2 steps Left, 1 step Forward
LB: 2 steps Left, 1 step Backward
Example moves: H3:FR (2 front, 1 right), H3:RF (2 right, 1 front)

2 Implement a dynamic team composition feature:
Allow players to choose their team composition at the start of each game.
Ensure the game logic can handle any combination of character types.

3 Add a spectator mode for other clients to watch ongoing games.

4 Implement a chat feature for players to communicate during the game.

5 Create an AI opponent that can play the game using basic strategy.

6 Implement a replay system that allows players to review past games move by move.

7 Add a ranking system that tracks player performance across multiple games.
